Nephrotic syndrome is a condition that causes your kidneys to produce high levels of protein in your urine. It’s often the result of kidney damage.

Nephrosis is a type of kidney disease that ultimately can lead to kidney failure. It’s also often the result of damage to the kidneys from either physical or chemical changes.

Tips for prevention
Like with many of the other leading causes of death, taking better care of your health can help you prevent kidney disease. Consider the following:

Tips for prevention
Suicide prevention aims to help people find treatment that encourages them to end suicidal thoughts and start finding healthier ways to cope.
